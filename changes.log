    Basiin.db.sql:  keep working
    init.js:        Decided to make basiin a non touchdown object (no var
                    references it). Plugins and user code will be incorporated
                    into the generated object, this way everyone can call every
                    other's public api. Comms will be taken up as functions
                    returned by the script tags. 
                    Function names will be autogenerated hash values by the
                    framework. Transfer & Transaction ids are numeric values
                    created by the servers now.
                    Example: User code calls:
                        tell/transactionId/transferId/responseVar/data
                             Server returns script:
                        var responseVar = function(){
                            //the code that will be executed by the basiin obj
                        }
                             once the onload event fires basiin will execute
                             that var in it's internal context, having access
                             to all functionality and extensibility. After the
                             response is executed the variable is unset.
                             Care has to be put on hash tag creation, the
                             variable can't exists beforehand.
