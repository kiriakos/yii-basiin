Yii-basiin is the yii-module-based impementation of the basiin bookmarklet 
application toolset. It consists of clientside javsascript, a yii-module that 
keeps track of sessions-auth-transactions-transfers and a passable preloader
script inteded for use in the bookmarklet for fast (cached) instantiation of the
bookmarklet UI.

Basiin is intended as a small toolset to get you going writing rich Bookmarklet 
applications without having to think too much about communication handling,
security, messing up the resident site etc.

NOTE: Basiin is NOT secure! It is designed to be as non existent as possible
      but the truth is that from the moment you are transmitting data through
      script tags it can be read by anybody having access to the dom. Still
      basiin at least doesn't expose any functionality to the underlying web 
      page, since it is completely contained inside its own closure. Two things 
      that in th e future will make basiin more secure is the inclusion of 
      crypto.js which will allow fully encrypted communication between the 
      basiin application instance and the server and the future inclusion of 
      CORS transfers for wherever it is possible.
      

This is the Yii module version of basiin.  If you are looking for a vanilla php 
implementation for basiin; sorry I haven't written one.
